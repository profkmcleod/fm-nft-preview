## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The overlay methods found online were not intuitive for me. This caused me to explore blend modes and CSS more deeply.

### Continued development

There is intermittent screen flickering when I hover on the image. I would like to identify the reason for this.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) - This helped me recall the syntax for CSS variables.
- [Google Font - Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit ) 
- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ ) - This is an excellent flexbox resource
